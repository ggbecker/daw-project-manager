/// Scans a single scan-root directory and imports every DAW project it finds

/// This is the shared core behind every "I just added a projects folder"
/// entry point *except* the dashboard (which runs the heavier full [_scanAll]
/// over every root). Before it existed, the startup dialog and the onboarding
/// wizard added the root but never scanned it, and the background folder
/// watcher only reacts to *later* filesystem activity — so a folder that
/// already contained projects stayed empty in the UI until the user hit
/// "Rescan" or relaunched the app.

/// It intentionally does not touch `recentlyDiscoveredProjectsProvider`: a
/// freshly-added root has no "seen last time" baseline, so everything found
/// is initial population, not a new-since-last-time discovery.
