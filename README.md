# DAW Project Manager

Cross-platform app for organizing and tracking music production projects. Scan your drives, manage metadata, track todos, group releases, and sync everything via Google Drive.

Supports **macOS**, **Windows**, **Android** (closed testing).

---

## Features

- **Smart two-phase scanning** — instant file detection, then background deep extraction of BPM, key, and DAW version.
- **Customizable production phases** — rename, reorder, color, and mark phases as "finished"; not limited to a fixed Idea → Finished pipeline.
- **Task Queue** — every open todo across every project in one unified, checkable list.
- **Releases** — group projects into EPs/albums/singles with artwork, description, attached files, and a "download all as ZIP" export.
- **Project & Todo Templates** — spin up new projects pre-filled from a saved template; import reusable todo checklists.
- **Music Player** — a full library player on desktop (queue, shuffle, Camelot-wheel key-compatible auto-queue) and a "Now Playing" screen on mobile, on top of the per-project preview player.
- **Playlists** *(Android/iOS)* — ordered sequences of preview songs for reviewing work on the go.
- **Statistics** — global library dashboard plus per-project phase/activity history.
- **Multiple Profiles** — fully isolated scan roots, projects, and settings per profile.
- **Google Drive sync** *(Windows/macOS/Android/iOS)* — back up metadata, preview songs, and artwork, with an optional auto-backup interval (30 min / hourly / 6-hourly / daily). Not available on Linux (see `flatpak/README.md`); use local backup/restore instead.
- **Background / tray mode** *(desktop)* — keep running after closing the window, with a tray/menu-bar icon for quick backup and work-session controls.
- **Cross-platform sharing** — shares preview songs through the OS share sheet, transcoding to AAC (macOS) or MP3 (Windows, via bundled ffmpeg) when the source format isn't shareable directly.
- **9 languages** — fully localized UI, switchable at any time.

## Metadata Extraction

Deep Scan reads BPM, musical key, DAW version, and (Reaper only) project notes directly from certain project files. Everything else needs the field entered manually, or picked up from an optional `bpm.txt`/`key.txt` file dropped next to the project. See **Settings → Metadata Extraction** in the app for the full breakdown by DAW.

| Automatic extraction | BPM | Key | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ableton Live | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Bitwig Studio | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Cubase / Nuendo | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| FL Studio | ✓ | | ✓ | |
| MAGDA | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Reaper | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

All other supported DAWs are detected and scanned but rely on manual entry today.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter 3.41.9** (stable) — [install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Platform tooling:
  - **macOS / iOS** — Xcode (latest)
  - **Windows** — Visual Studio with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
  - **Android** — Android Studio (latest)
  - **Linux** — GTK/GStreamer/libsecret dev headers, plus a C++ toolchain:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config unzip \
      libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev libsecret-1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
      libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
    ```
    (Linux isn't a released platform yet — see `flatpak/README.md` for the
    in-progress Flathub packaging effort — but `flutter run -d linux` works
    for local development.)

### Install and generate

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd daw_project_manager

flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Run

```bash
flutter run -d macos       # macOS
flutter run -d windows     # Windows
flutter run -d linux       # Linux
flutter run -d <device-id> # Android or iOS — list with: flutter devices
```

### Google Drive sync (optional, not available on Linux)

Drive sync requires OAuth config injected into `lib/config/oauth_config.dart` (not versioned). This only actually enables Drive sign-in on Windows/macOS/Android/iOS — on Linux the feature is hidden in the UI regardless of what's in this file (see `flatpak/README.md` for why), so there's no need to run this setup step on a Linux dev machine.

**Quickest way — use the setup script:**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
./scripts/setup_local_oauth_config.sh

# Windows
.\scripts\setup_local_oauth_config.ps1
```

The script prompts for your Google Cloud OAuth credentials (`DESKTOP_CLIENT_ID`, `DESKTOP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ANDROID_WEB_CLIENT_ID`) and writes the file for you. Without it the app runs normally; only Drive features won't authenticate.

## Releasing

Push a version tag to trigger the CI release workflow:

```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

CI outputs: macOS `.dmg`, Windows `.msix`, Android `.apk` and `.aab`.

Required GitHub secrets: `DESKTOP_CLIENT_ID`, `DESKTOP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ANDROID_WEB_CLIENT_ID`.
