## Non-negotiables

### Tests are part of every task
- Every bug fix must include a regression test that would have caught the bug.
- Every new feature must include tests covering its logic in full.
- Run `flutter test` before every commit — only commit if all tests pass.
- If logic is too deep in the widget tree to unit test, write the closest possible test (model/service/repository level) and note explicitly what cannot be automated.

### Always use AppLocalizations for UI strings
- Never hardcode user-visible text in widget trees.
- Any label, tooltip, snackbar message, dialog text, or button label must have a key in `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` and be referenced via `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.someKey`.
- Add the key to all locale ARB files, then run `flutter gen-l10n`.
- The app ships in 9 languages — hardcoded strings silently break all non-English users.
- `app_pt.arb` is Brazilian Portuguese only — there is a single Portuguese locale for this app, and it targets Brazil. Never introduce European Portuguese spelling or vocabulary (e.g. "ficheiro", "deteção"/"detetar", "descarregar", "ecrã", "utilizador", "está a fazer"-style progressive) — use the Brazilian equivalent instead (e.g. "arquivo", "detecção"/"detectar", "baixar", "tela", "usuário", "está fazendo"). When adding or editing a `pt` string, match the vocabulary already established in the rest of `app_pt.arb`.

### New model fields must be evaluated for Drive sync AND local backup
- When adding a field to `MusicProject` (or any synced model), decide: is this user-generated data or a device-local preference?
- **User data** (metadata, timers, todos, paths) → add to `_serializeProject` AND `_deserializeProject` in `lib/services/google_drive_sync_service.dart`. If skipped, the field is silently lost on every Drive restore.
- **Device-local settings** (theme, layout, update checks) → do NOT sync. `AppSettings` fields are generally device-local.
- Also check `lib/services/backup_service.dart` (local file export/import) for the same question, for any *global* (non-per-profile) data — `TodoTemplate`, `ProjectTemplate`, `TemplateRoot`, custom mixdown folder names, phase settings. This is Flatpak's only backup path (see below), so a field skipped here is a field Flatpak users can never back up at all, not just "won't survive a Drive restore."

### Google Drive sync is not offered inside Flatpak
- `GoogleDriveSyncService.isSupported` is `false` only when actually running inside a Flatpak sandbox (detected via the `/.flatpak-info` marker file every Flatpak app has at runtime), `true` everywhere else — including the plain Linux tarball and the AppImage. Every UI entry point to `GoogleDriveSyncPage` (dashboard, profile page, startup dialog, tray menu) is gated on it — don't add a new one without the same gate.
- Why: the desktop OAuth flow requires a client secret (confirmed against a live Google sign-in attempt — PKCE alone isn't accepted for this app's "Desktop app" OAuth client type; see the long comment on `_desktopClientSecret` in `google_drive_sync_service.dart`). Flathub's build sandbox has no secret-injection mechanism, so shipping the secret there would mean committing it in the open in the public Flathub submission repo. Not offering the feature was chosen over that for Flatpak specifically — the tarball/AppImage are built by this repo's own CI (`build_linux` in `release.yml`), same trust boundary as Windows/macOS, so they get the real secret too.
- The Flatpak build compiles `lib/config/oauth_config.dart` from the committed template's placeholder text directly (no real values, no GitHub secrets involved) — see `flatpak/README.md`. The Linux tarball/AppImage build (`build_linux`) injects real values from GitHub secrets like every other desktop platform.

## Architecture

### State management — Riverpod
- All providers live in `lib/providers/providers.dart`.
- Main data flow: `repositoryProvider` → `allProjectsStreamProvider` → `projectsProvider` (filtered/sorted) → UI.
- Search state is per-tab: `projectsSearchProvider`, `releasesSearchProvider`, `queueSearchProvider`, etc.

### Local persistence — Hive CE
- Models with `@HiveType` / `@HiveField` and a `part` directive (e.g. `Release`, `TodoTemplate`) use code-generated adapters — run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after changing them.
- `MusicProject` and other models have manually written `TypeAdapter`s inline in their model file — `build_runner` skips these intentionally.
- Adapters are registered in `ProjectRepository` with `isAdapterRegistered` guards to prevent double-registration.

### Platform detection
- Use `MobileUtils.isMobile()` (from `lib/utils/mobile_utils.dart`) for mobile vs desktop checks — not `Platform.isAndroid` or `Platform.isIOS` directly.
- Desktop = macOS + Windows + Linux. Mobile = Android + iOS.
- Primary development and test target is **macOS**.
- Linux is otherwise a full desktop target. The only feature gap is Google Drive sync specifically inside the Flatpak build (see `GoogleDriveSyncService.isSupported` above) — the tarball/AppImage have it.

### Themes
- Two active themes: `AppThemeType.neonDark` and `AppThemeType.classicDark`.
- `AppThemeType.studioLight` exists in the enum but is hidden from the UI until it is ready — do not expose it in menus or the theme switcher cycle.

## UI conventions

### Launching a project in its DAW always goes through `launchProjectInDaw`
- Use `launchProjectInDaw(context, ref, project)` from `lib/ui/session_actions.dart` for every "open/launch in DAW" button — never call `FileLauncher.launchProject`/`launchWithBinary` directly from UI code.
- Why: this is the one place that knows about the DAW executable-override system (`ProjectRepository.getDawLaunchCommand`, Settings > DAW Locations — every desktop platform), its missing-path remediation, and the configure prompt (`showDawLaunchCommandDialog`). The prompt fires up front on Linux (no dependable OS file association) and only after a failed standard launch on Windows/macOS. A direct `FileLauncher` call bypasses all of that. The decision lives in the pure `resolveDawLaunchAction` / `shouldPromptDawLocationAfterFailedLaunch` helpers.

### Destructive confirm-dialog buttons need an explicit `foregroundColor`
- Any `ElevatedButton`/`FilledButton` styled with a hardcoded red `backgroundColor` (delete/remove/reset confirmations) must also set `foregroundColor` — Flutter does not derive readable text contrast from an arbitrary `backgroundColor` on its own, and the default has been wrong before.
- Pairing used throughout the app: `Colors.red` / `Colors.red.shade700` → `foregroundColor: Colors.white`; `Colors.red.shade300` (lighter, used for less-destructive actions like "Hide" or "Remove") → `foregroundColor: Colors.black`.

### A `Row` pairing a text field with a button needs `CrossAxisAlignment.center`
- `Row(children: [Expanded(child: TextField(...)), button])` defaults to `CrossAxisAlignment.start`, which top-aligns the button against the field's full decorated height (label + border) instead of visually centering it — looks broken, especially once the field grows (e.g. an `errorText`).
- Always set `crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center` on this shape of `Row`. This has been the same one-line bug fixed independently in multiple dialogs — grep for `CrossAxisAlignment.start` near a `TextField` before assuming a new field+button row is fine as-is.

### A DAW logo shown as a field's `prefixIcon` needs explicit sizing
- `Image.asset(getDawLogoPath(dawType), ...)` renders at the source PNG's native size if unconstrained — oversized and breaking the field's layout when used as an `InputDecoration.prefixIcon`.
- Always pass `width: 16, height: 16, fit: BoxFit.contain`, with an `errorBuilder` falling back to `Icon(Icons.piano, color: color)` for DAWs with no logo asset. See `_buildDawPrefixIcon` in `lib/ui/project_detail_page.dart` for the canonical implementation to mirror.

### A grid row's "open full detail page" action uses `Icons.assignment` + `tooltipViewDetails`
- Every `TrinaGrid` actions column that navigates to a dedicated detail page (not an inline edit dialog) uses `Icon(Icons.assignment)` with `tooltip: l10n.tooltipViewDetails`, matching `dashboard_page.dart`'s project rows. Keep new detail-page entry points (grid action icon, row double-tap) consistent with this rather than inventing a new icon/label per page.

## Common tasks

### Adding a new DAW
1. Add the file extension (with comment) to `ScannerService.supportedExtensions` in `lib/services/scanner_service.dart`.
2. Map the extension to a display name in `MetadataExtractor` (`lib/services/metadata_extractor.dart`).
3. Optionally add a logo asset and register it in the logo map in `dashboard_page.dart`.
4. Update the supported DAWs table in `README.md`.

### Adding a new UI string
1. Add the key + English value to `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`.
2. Add the same key to every other `app_<locale>.arb` file (use the English value as a placeholder if translation is pending).
3. Run `flutter gen-l10n` — generated code lands in `lib/generated/l10n/`.
4. Reference via `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.yourKey` — never import the generated file directly; it is re-exported from the package.

### Adding a new MusicProject field
1. Add a `@HiveField(N)` with the next available index.
2. Add a default value in the `MusicProjectAdapter.read()` for backwards compatibility with existing boxes.
3. Add the field to `copyWith()`.
4. Decide sync scope (see Non-negotiables above) and update `_serializeProject` / `_deserializeProject` if needed.
5. Update `TestFactories.makeProject()` in `test/helpers/test_factories.dart` to expose the field for tests.
